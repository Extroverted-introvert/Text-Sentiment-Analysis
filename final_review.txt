Awesome product#NOTE7PRO
I am facing screen flickering at low brightness and there is screen bleeding in my device.  I have checked other redmi note 7 pro but they don't have this issue.  and flipkart refuse to replace my products.  invested 14k for a defective product.
having error in ear speaker it's making noise when call is going on..  flipkart not giving replacement of product for this issue. earpiece issue is resolved by updating phone software.

amazing camera and amazing display
awesome phone & superb build quality ,just loved it ...
Price 10/10,camera 8/10, battery 9/10, performance 9.5/10. Overall it is king of this price segment.
classic look.... battery back up is good.... faster processor.... solid camera. ....good if they have provided 20w charger.......
Nicely built and very fast. Compact and light weight. The display is really good and ambient light sensing is awesome. The glass backside is slippery and so need to be careful. Lots of ads in inbuilt apps. Intial camera experiences are good. No hanging issues while using camera even in 48MP-pro mode. Although i'm not a great photographer attaching some first shots.
Got in first sale only .... Thank you Mi for such a good phone 😍😍😍 Just loving it ! 😊
great product.

super duper amazing....
iam facing screen flickering at low brightness and there is screen bleeding in my device.. I have checked other redmi note 7 pro. but they don't have this issue and flifcart refuse to replace my products..
camera is lagging, update required and 48mp clarity is not up to the mark. mobile automatically restart sometimes,call audio quality is good. No software issue. No heating issue. Battery back up is good- 24hrs after hard usage. speaker is good. For 13,999 currently in the market this is the best one.
Good mobile.. Touch is smooth.. I have been using realme 1. Though this mobile supports quick charge 4 the charger provided in the box is normal.. Still a good Buy.. Excellent camera.. Overall a good Buy.. Highly recommended...
best mi ph ever.... and such a beautiful camera...❤️❤️❤️
product is very nice except the speaker(earpiece for call). I m getting buzzing sound from the speaker on every calls and everytime. I complained it and the technician told me that its a bug in each device. Can anyone having the same issue???????? Please reply guys.

The earpiece is not working properly.  Whenever someone talks,  I get a radio like sound in the background.  Please help.
best of the best mobile at this price.... love u redmi
just killer
great phone in great price with great camera
I have replaced the phone two times but still i am facing MIC problem with the phone. Phone looks good and performance also nice... But the only problem is MIC, It is distracting the voice of others while on call
product awesome design but 48 mp camer taking more time to click the photo
Actually Phone is good but they are bormarding phone with Ads and installing too many Mi apps forcefully and none of them are useful.
It has a horrible performance in camera, if Xiomi cant optimize the camera bugs then this device is useless, camera stucks up while shooting the pictures, this rating is based on actual usuage of device. Xiomi should fix these bugs ASAP.
superb mobile in design and performance.

CAMERA BEAST ....guys I am not even a middle class guy (a lower middle class guy) who can't afford phone even after two years so seeing the hype of the camera I bought this phone to Meet my expectations even a little but....no that's not at all. It's compared to one plus 6T ....guys believe me it doesn't come even close to one plus 6t in camera as shown in the launch event. That was all just to create hype.... it's having eis while one plus 6t having ois so just to tell you that I don't think...
Value for money
Camera is not good as expected front camera is also very poor redmi note 6 pro camera as too better
Good and Fast delivery by filpkart.  Redmi note 7 pro is value for money. Nice camera. Good gaming performance.  Fast processor.  Sharp and clear camera.  Good optimization of battery.  Over all very good mobile at this price.
Awesome phone.. The camera is really awesome specially in night mode.. Sharing pic with you all.. Its all in low light..
my display broken when fall from 1 foot . I don't think it is Gorilla Glass 5. Very bad experience
good camera quality.....everything in this phone is good....but i think this phone's battery is draining fast...so xiaomi should put more mah battery..like around 4230mah-4500mah.....btw i like this ph
I ordered 3 Rd sale and what a phone osm
The best smartphone right now which can even put some flagship phones to shame in the camera department. Absolutely a worthy purchase & it won't disappoint you. The camera is the strongest point here. It's the best value for money device you can buy now.
best in this price range
satisfied 😍
Excellent
It is a great device , awsome screen quality , great for media consumption , performance is on top , no lag in day to day use as well as on pubg , 1 day full battery backup with heavy uses , and also takes just 1hr 35min to fully charge by a QC 3.0 Charger , Overall it the best value for money device in this price range.
Honest review...The camera is gimmick only to sell the product.Battery backup in my case doesn't even last for a complete day...48mp is the main thing in this phone on paper but after paying 14k what you get is restart the app or phone again and again as it hangs when you open the camera..Too bad product.Worst thing you can't get your money refunded and I can see many people facing the same problem with camera but the company is just busy in another flash sale instead of checking customers pr...
nice
shot on note 7pro brilliant
Absolutely mind blowing
Awsm product in 17k segment
super mobile
perfect phone... awesome camera with super design
all are good
The earpiece is pathetic, and there is a lot of distraction sound when on call. I have repeatedly checked with several sims and networks but looks like the phone has a problem. Very disappointing with the phone, how can they not test a basic function like earpiece sound.
vry very bad product display problem
camera problem, camera not working, heating problem, hanging problem. very very worst  mobile. flipkart waste . 48mp camera is just a name only when I try to open 48mp camera app crashed says restart the app so don't buy any one
redmi Note 7 Pro is awesome design display is very good but in camera mode 48  megapixel is little more improve because 48 megapixel mod is hanging problem when he capture picture
excellent...
Mobile looks Very Stylish in Design... The main Attractive thing is it's 48 MP Camera . On Performance level Snapdragon 675 One of New Processor gives better performance other than phone available in this price range. 4000 mAh battery life giving more Entertainment and gaming experience... But Screen they gives IPS LCD PANEL instead Super Amooled Display otherwise it rocks the world I will giving 4.5/5 Rating
Nice mobile with good features camera was superb,  performance is excellent, value for money..  Flipkart courier delivery person was delivered the mobile on time and good speaker too.  I bought this product last week.. Everything is going well..
I'm writing this review after 3 weeks of usage got it on 27th march flash sale. First of all i want to say camera 📷 is super-duper awesome 👍😎 Snapdragon 675 performance is really really good u can play PUBG And all heavy games without any lag on high quality graphics. Call quality is super, it have volume boost feature for noisy public places. If we talk about design.. KILLER HAI BOSS..😘❤ Full glass body gives a premium look. JUST GO FOR IT BLINDLY....😍✌👌
great camera
After 2 days of heavy usage..  1) awesome photo clarity. Mostly with back camera and then front camera is nice 2) awesome battery when used by heavy user 3) lil bit heating when used for 1 hours on full brightness 4) nice video clarity with EIS in back camera But  they shud provide EIS IN FRONT CAMERA AS WELL 5) NICE SLOW MOTION quality with 1080p at 120fps but they should give the edit option in SLOW MOTION video so that we can decide where apply slow motion effect. 6)camera hangs sometime w...
mobile getting heat but delivery boy service is good
best Product at this Price but front camera could be better.
excellent value for money
awesome all the things
excellent Camera..better than dslr just loved it 😘😘
awesome camera nd build quality is also good feels like a pro
speaker problem.  speaker not working properly.
Nice features pack phone in this price range. Camera is just superb. 48 MP in pro mode. Recved in 1st sale. Value for money. Thnxs flipkart for delivery on time in just 2 days.
It's a dud.  Expected it to live up to the hype.  Already own Note 6 Pro. Earpeace sounds so cheap. Voice you get to hear is so unnatural.  Selfie camera quality has dwindled compared to 6 Pro. Front camera ain't that great either. In nutshell,  7 Pro is absolutely skippable.
I received my redmi note 7 pro yesterday..Its camera is just awsome.Battery quality is also good.I think if you are planning to buy a mid rnge smartphone then definitely you should go for it..Its night mode is shocked me,realy it captured unbelievable images.Smooth performance.Snapdragon 675 wotks great.Thank you flipkart for delivering it to me.Its very hard to get this phone in flash sell..But I can buy it on 27 march..So happy with this phone..🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍
After a long time expressive design. 💯by redmi*(xiaomi), i am a mi fan ❤️ previously used mobile note 4 then note 6 pro. & now note 7 pro.. Worth the money 💵 ✔️📌.. No one can beat this phone at  present.#. 🚩🚩This phone is definitely *NO. 1 MID range phone of 2019. 💯💯
Camera lagging issue. software is not well optimised.
I have bought this phone on the first sale launched in flipkart. First of all,  the 48MP camera is just a hype created and nothing else.  12MP is as good as 48MP. The night mode provided here is awesome though.  Now leaving apart the camera this phone is a beast at its price.  I can play pubg in HD here which I could not in my honor 9 lite.  Performance and speed is quite good as of now.  Screen resolution is awesome.  The phone does not heat up even after continuous usage.  A drawback is a h...
everything is just awesome in this device. except the hybrid sim slot.
This is killer phone at this price point, specially the performance of the phone is jaw dropping. Camera is just awesome. Just Xiaomi needs to do some software optimization. Overall i'll strongly recommend this phone to everyone who want Beast phone in budget category.
Flipkart support is not helpful at all. The 4G signals are coming very low as compared to other phones. The technician visits and says that all is ok and does nothing. Terrible support from Flipkart and defective product from Xiaomi.
the device is good I would not say it is exactly 48MP but it has some insane features .. its ok for everyone who is looking to buy a device around 15K
super duper se uper
best phone
nice camra super
front camera is disappointing when compared to note 6 pro or poco f1, but nice design, both side gorila glass 5 protection, excellent battery, quick charge 4.0 . awesome
Camera is good. Night mod and Black mod
One of the best phone at ths price. Had lots of hurdles to get the phone booked for atleast a week . But finally mission Mi accomplished . ..
Very thing is sooo good in the phone. Only when we use the camera for longer time or watch anything for longer time. it heats. Rest evrythng is perfect. Getting such a beautiful phone in this price charge is unbelievable. The glass finish on the back is too attractive. Luckily, I got this phone on first sale and loved evry bit of it. In love with it.
I would've given 5 stars in the first week of usage of this phone but slowly all the problems stated creeping in. Firstly the camera app. It just keeps crashing even after the update and while taking selfies, the camera app shows everything frame by frame, it's that slow! Secondly the performance. It lags so much while opening and closing apps even redmi note 5 Pro was better in terms of camera and performance. I'm just hoping xiaomi will rectify this in upcoming updates. Also there are batte...
Camera quality is excellent .
beast camera,  long battery backup, rigid design  and superb processor.  fast charging without heating problem and amazing display.  best phone for money value
Quality , outdoor visibility  of Display is good. SD 675 performance is best in 15k category .RAM management & MIUI on top of the android pie is good. Selfie camera is above average & Rear camera is decent in 12MP & 48MP. & Night mode of camera is dope!!!
I am using this phone for 2 days only, but it already impress me so much..with the performance in gaming like pubg sndr 675 nailed it.. i dont know why people find no difference in 12 mp and 48 mp pics but 48mp pics are far better in detailing, believe me i have dslr and i know the difference.. there is no crackling sound in earpiece in my device , no screen bleeding ,, no camera hanging problem. and the phone is not bulky at all... Speaker produce enough sound.. and dont worry about adds in ...
Good product
Phone is great. Only durability is the issue. Since frame is plastics & its sandwich between Gorilla Glass 5.
great product
Note 7 Pro Is really capture good images.
very nice phone I love it, but ear piece volume very low and sound quality is very bad.
good
value for money. 48mp camera image takes more time. very slight difference in 12 mp and 48 mp images ...only image size difference. no EIS in 4K recording. battery is ok. no fast charger in the Box but phone supports fast charging you can buy fast charger from market.
I like the product but please don't buy the black colour it's totally finger print magnet
Got #1 sale lucky one very much appreciated and awaited smartphone
Value For Money
outstanding..,
speaker sound like cracking.
is this handset having hanging and freezing problem also having one more issue with battery that its take more time to charge the phone and battery backup is not good also and look is well,  camera also average.
Awesome
Nice service of flipkart thanks.lets talk about the phone.lookwise good. 48MP camera is just marketing strategy where it's take pics like 12MP.Cant compete with Note 5 pro camera. In low light take good pics.Sometimes camera lagg. Display quality is good. they don't provide quick charge. battery life is good not a better. sound good. now finaly only the reason for I bought this phone. For the game. gaming experience is awsome. best graphic and processor. overall phone is good but don't buy if...
best phone in this price segment
poor aftersales services and i also got some problem with device and that is earpiece is not working prpblem it has some disturbances. i m extremely disappointed
Awesome mobile
perfect mobile phone for Camera.....Ultimate in photo shoot
it's camera is soo much lagging that it does not start we have to restart the phone,if we want to click 2 pics as soon as possible we have to wait for approximately  3-4 seconds
Unhappy because of camera bulge and nothing is special with 48MP camera. If we use 48MP mode then we have to wait 15 sec to process the image. Without providing fast charger what is the use quick charge feature. This means company supporting 3rd party intervention. Suppose if I use any other brand quick charger and if any issue raises then they'll simply void warranty by pointing the use of other brand charger. Finally company provides soft case but no use because that won't protect camera.
the device heats up . 38 degrees without any games or camera usage.
mobile doesn't work perfectly
No words to explain this beast
Awsm....
Camera is overated. Not better than any 12 mp. Also, miui is pain in the donkey
I just get it today. It's feel like a killer phone. Nice all around, spacaily camera is too good.
thank you xiaomi... as well flipkart also for fast delivery....
Nice product never expect the quality.. feel like premium mobile in hand.  Speaker problem after new update it's now working fine
This Mobile is Really Awesome! Thanks to Xiaomi. Camera is incredible. I'hv fallen in love...
Battery problems  without net use. And some times Mobile not operate... Some times microphone properly not work... More heat ..... My mobile redmi note 7pro...some times face unlocking not properly use....
Everything is good in mobile but i am not satisfied with flipkart exchange policy. They want new one mobile in exchange.
awesome phone .. design also very good
I am using it from past 3 weeks.  Performance is very good.   No heating issue.  Camera superb
camra performence is very low. camera error is occuring at the time of capturing images on 48mp camera
everything is good expect MIUI o didn't like user interface. but over all nice value for money.
camera is lagging and asking to restart the device
Osm mobile
still it has to be improve
very nice..
Don't buy thise phone..  Camera 48 P  not working. And no return option onely change set.
camera lags very badly out of the box without even installing any apps ,also being crashed many times ,xiaomi should fix tje issue,is any one facing same issue.
camera is good at this budget..but the camera module protrudes from back of the phone very much..I have tried some thick cases but camera bump is huge.when you keep phone flat in any surface the phone rests on its camera..so if you buy it , keep it safe..
phone looks good but camera is not adequate. performance is ok as per new phone but camera seems dull. very bad experience
very nice phone
Amazing mobile worth of every buck
#48 mega pixel camera is works best in day light, phone is very smooth, no lags & simply beautiful Phone.
phone speaker is very poor and phetatic voice is not clear.
Not good phone.. Network strength is low.. Speaker quality is bad.. Company is not resolving problem.. Bad phone.. Advice not to buy this phone.. Unsatisfied with phone and company reply
great camera phone in lower price
nice mobile
Good
great phone,  feels good in hand and amazing performance overall.  5/5 in value for money.

No competitor in the market for this product
excellent camera 😍
Guys, if you are planning to buy Nebula Red variant then please beware that it is actually PINK and Not Red! They don't take it back later hence better not book it if you don't like Pink.
Awesome #redminote7pro 😍😍😍
good
delivery boy are very good and nice
This was one of the best phone purchases recently. Though realme is giving a tough competition but this one is top notch. (I own realme U1 too). Display is very good in this price point. Camera is much better than all the phones I owned till now. (I had 2 flagship phones till date. Yet realme also comes near to it in camera). Battery performance is very good and USB type C and quick charging is icing on the cake.
Top class mobile under 20k.. go for it with cool mind..
Software need to huge improvement at all camera quality is worst nlno one is happy with revert from Samsung phones but in other devices camera quality is favolous
AWSOME PHOTOS BY RN 7 PRO

certainly this one is value for money, I got two updates so far, I think heating issue has been resolved, I feel less heat now, display is good,no regrets for not going with amoled display of Samsung mobiles, performance is very smooth, camera also very good in this price range, my advice is don't be excited very much about this mobile, If you don't get in the flash sale don't worry you may get little more better device than this in coming months, if you get one you will not regret rather.
A true Value for Money Phone
Awesome
Super
best phone in this price segment ...only miui adds are disturbing
Awesome mobile go for it.
it is nice product no comparison for any device in price nice a performance and camera nice battery always mi phone better good nice Snapdragon 675 new version update MIUI 10.2.7.0 night mode picture all best
photo is good. & Excellent. but flipkart is get extra mobile protection is get not good.
vallu for money,best mobile phone
its all good. I have no idea how but on second day there is a scratch in middle of screen. They claim it to be super strong, doesn't seems so.
super nice
best mobile in under 15k, small camera issues in mobile i think next update is ratify redmi
superb phone but the battery is draing out very fast
Very nice performance and good looking phone. Its camera quality also good. Overall it is a very good phone under this price range.
It's very great full mobile
Good Phone for MI lover. Nice camera at this price range . Overall good
Everything is great with this budget but I am getting very bad noise from earpiece speaker.
xiomi is awesome.  The product is too good at this price range.
camera Beast... powerfull processor and best optimizing battery drain thats enhances battery life.
awesome and unexpected features
excellent budget killer
Awesome Camera 48M + 5M No Need DSLR. 😜
one of the best 2019 powerful performance value for money
camera not as expected....
Average
The best phone with value for money..
Nice Phone
it's all-rounder....great value for money.... descent looks 😉
Best mobile under 14k worth for money. But still they can improve it with inbuilt finger print sensor with 15k.
very nice mobile
super phone
Awesome phone
camera quality is below.. dont expect on 48 mp.. normal 12 mp Photos are good.. while talking phone low voice is there and need high volume.. my negatives camera and voice... otherwise all are good and value for money..blue colour best
camera not clear 48MP
budget cracking mobile but camera sucks on 48 mp mode it tends to slow not expected like this, another issue is battery drains quick on playing pubg... sometime phone lags.. Xiaomi should release an update to fix this issues otherwise phone is good 👍😇
Device Is Super.. And Camera Is Working Awesome But There Are Minor Lags And Bugs In Camera UI.. So It's A Great Value For Money.. Device.. The Performance And Gaming Is Just Mind Blowing..
Let's talk software first.                                                      It comes with miui 10 on top of android pie. This ui is feature packed with a lot of things that you won't find on stock android. And then there's the ad situation but there is a workaround to that and I would recommend you to turn off recommendations in each app manually.                                                                   Camera- The best in this segment.                                     This ph...
battery backup is good but not upto mark drain quickly at night but maybe i got the defected device....camera performance in daylight is awesome nd night shots are cool with flash.... performance is nice when doin regular chores but shows lags during games like PUBG....if u wanna play heavy game opt for higher RAM variant...
i got a faulty product...and not replaced... but refunded the amount.
not is good low poor quality do not purchase friend
48 megapixel camera very hang to click photo
Dont think it is 48 mp like dslr camera....  There is no detail in 48 mp camera picture like DSLR camera...  But in this price segment it is best.....
overall set specification are very good but front camera not so good. ram management is very poor. display is good.
unexpected camera performance.
Best in price segment
camera is ok ok not well
very nice product is camera is amazing thanks redmi & Flipkart
good
amazing
excellent redmi mobile 😘
Very very nice product camera its adorable every think is gud
having issue with phone mic
usually I don't like Chinese products but when I see oppo printed on jersey of Indian cricket team and vivo ipl promoted by Indian government, then I ignored that dislike and say nice nice product.
A perfect Chinese mobile phone with good features and cheap price. I will recommend Samsung Galaxy A50 or M30 instead of Redmi note 7 pro.
great phone
when you click with 48MP..It's slow down.worst phone ever seen by MI.
best smartphone in this price range.... 😘😘😘😘😘
Redmi Note 7 pro is the worst of all Redmi series. I have been using both Redmi note 5 pro and also bought Redmi note 6 pro on the first day itself. The battery performance is worst and the camera(Front) quality is a big disappointment. Let me start with battery. I will compare it with Redmi note 6 Pro. Redmi note 6 pro minimum temperature even in this summer is 25 degrees and max of 32 degrees with background running apps. on the other hand, Redmi note 7 pro minimum temperature starts with 3...
3rd grade product... Earpiece problem, Camera software problem, Battery draining very fast if i kept standby for 1 hour it consumes 5 to 8% percentage Battery. 2 times i upgraded software. and did resetting handset.. but still all problems are same. Don't Buy Note 7 Pro. Go for Note 5 Pro(6gb/64gb).
one problem in Redmi note 7 pro "find device closed unexpectedly" do note by this phone
Super phone... great price...
Slippery glass body, heating issues, software glitches, poor front camera.
speaker quality is very very poor...when we are using headphone than voice is clear...otherwise a lot of noise therein speaker doing calling.
Awesome👏✊👍
not satisfied
every thing is good,  but I face a problem with earpiece, that produce buzz sound while on call.
front luks very irritating because of  big bazzels
phone hanging issue heat issue touch issue camera issue everything is there very worst mobile replacement policy's is 100% cheating i show the video for hanging dont accept waste of my 14000 money
Why the hell my return request is being rejected so many times after receiving damaged product.  The ear piece of the device is improperly fixed and a green line appears and disappears many a times at the right edge of the phone leaving my screen hang for a few mins .  Why should one suffer with damaged product when he paid the full sum of money for it.  Strict action should be taken as soon as possible I want a fresh product instead of this damaged peice.
nice phone  osm camera
It is a paisa vasool device. Redmi once again prove that no one can beat them. In Rs. 14,000/- if you get this device, then what else you want? I love Redmi Note 7 Pro. I have used Redmi Note 5 Pro, Redmi Note 6 Pro and now using Redmi note 7 Pro. Day by day the quality of the camera, processor etc. are increasing.
My first day with this phone and I'm loving it.  The packaging was done very well, delivery was quick.  The specs of this phone is just mind boggling.  Value for money.
The camera is too laag use 48mp. I think 6Gb version is better than 4gb. Thanks
No doubt, handset is powerful in this price range with great camera but i will not recommend any one to buy this because of its Chinese origin.
redmi note 7 pro have manufacturer defect, speaker is not work well
awesome camera very beautiful I am happy
Good product
screen broke within 10 days.
awesome phone at the price range of 13999 impressive camera nice battery life
just awesome but now wait for realme 3pro for camera and performance with fast charging inbuilt charger.
super phone and camera great picture quality
Phone is very good. I found it in a sell. Camera is not so good as expected.
nice cam..... wanna improve some fixes for48 mp..... performance is gud... battery also gud
amazing camera📷 & also bettry
Please improve the performance of the CAMERA. I bought this phone for CAMERA ONLY. BUT DISAPPOINTED. It got stuck/hang while taking continues photos. It happening continuesly. Please fix this camera issue at the earliest. Thanks in advance.
Best budget smartphone ☺️ value for money
Worst phone i ever had...lags a lot... proximity sensor is not working properly...during a call, phone's screen automatically turns on and that results in opening random apps...not gonnna buy mi again.
Volume of speaker is too low plz solve this
Overall this is phone is a beast in this price segment, the only problem is with the fast charging, it takes normal time to charge (2 hours). Camera quality is excellent. Satisfied with the product.
super quality camera value for money nice finishing looks like iPhone x
Very good phone for the price range! but 48 MP is only a gimmick not impressive as Nokia Lumia 1050. Rest of the things are best in the category. Definately worth a Try!
not awesome but good  phone
The best one in this range... no one can stand in 15 to 20 k
Simply awesome
Camera is not 48 MP
Value to money , We have compared camera , vdo quality , Face unlock every thing is in line with one +6T with more than half of the prize  . Must buy . lovely device _):

Nice phone but cannot apply face lock on apps please upgrade fastly. Sensor is fast camera is owsm but the problem is that camera pic space is too hight it's all most about 14 to 20 mb per photo even it's not clicked in pro mode. this quality is tremandus .
just wow
best midrange phone
A Good looking budget phone with good camera & the gaming performance is also good. you can play PUBG smoothly . Display quality is not so good as new Samsung's phone launch .but the average quality is much better then Samsung. Don't think twice just go for it.
This mobile has a serious problem.  Several of users including me are facing slow net connection speed using mobile data (take any sim, Jio, idea, Airtel). This has been widely reported since its release but Xiomi has refused to acknowledge the problem at their end. This is happening since note 7 pro is not compatible with 4G+ in India.  Flipkart doesn't acknowledge this as a problem, and my return is refused. Think twice before buying this phone. I am unfortunately stuck with it. Camera or s...
Product was broken
Getting this phone in today's competitive digital market where every company and brands are pushing their absolute best devices at such aggressive prices is a relief if not an achievement. Was skeptical of Redmi phones are hearing "so-so" reviews but the specs and the camera definitely got my attention. Decided to get this after much thorough research and chiding on other devices, tricky luck to get it in a flash sale. But life has been sailing smooth since this has arrived. A1 in performance...
Not good work hanging problems
nice
awesome phone in budget range. Really very good and smooth experience phone as compared to other phone.
48mp camera mode really works good and does not heat up playing games,C type charging port is an added advantage for quick transfer of datas,quick charge 3.0 supported
Xiaomi never leaves a chance to surprise u with its product. Its simply amazing and camera is so good. Thanks to flipkart for quick delivery. This is a power packed phone.
Redmi note 7 pro very nice phone
Battery could have been better

The phone is awesome..except the camera.The camera is laggy as hell.And 48mp mode have to be improve.The camera bump is very big,free case is most awkward,Give no protection on camera bump,I'm using it for 2 days and the camera getting slightly scratch.The battery backup have to improve.Fix this software issues and the this will be the best phone.
Amazing phone in 14k
heating problem in charging
In love with this phone.  it's features,  design,  display is best at this Price range. But the only problem I faced is in ordering this phone.  Flipkart please make more stocks available.

Purchased this beast after long time of waiting, but worth every penny of it's price. Nothing can beat it at it's price. Most powerful midrange processor sd675, best in class cameras, most premium build quality, great battery life, everything is amazing. PUBG runs smoothly on hd settings, even it's one of the first device to run fortnite at this price range. Loved this product.
Absolutely tremendous..  Phone of the year 👌
nice images capture
Superb better than realme 3pro.
Hands down best VFM right now. Crushes my Nokia 8.1(has better camera than One plus 6T) in camera. Blue looks amazing. Battery is fantastic and performance is too fast. Almost no compromise phone

Amazing camera better than realme 3 pro.

Great phone. I don't think there is any competition for this phone at this price range. Good performance and gaming speed is awesome. Redmi has changed the smartphone world. Anyone can afford a high performance smartphone at an affordable price. Well done Xiomi and Flipkart.

this phone is the game exchanger low budget high quality. Under 15k one of the best phones to choose
heat problem there but also good

Everything is gr8.. but slightly not satisfied with camera performance during low light.. in daytime its gr8.. and also there is no official Gcam available at the time.. maybe later if it is available.. then I think camera would do a better job..
Flipkart delivery Speed insane..note 7 pro is good phone....it is al rounder.. except in chrging speed and gpu is not good realme 3 pro...and also lagging in asphalt 9 gaming...good for pubg lvrs
phones by redmi are always great value for money, this pjone is no exception. only problem with redmi 8s

It's an elite phone within this price range..  picture quality is really nice without using 48 MP..  battery,  display and camera..  all are awesome. However sound quality need to improve..  While calling speaker sound is very low.. Overall the phone is amazing in this price range..

the mobile phone is excellent value for money, build quality, camera, display everything is on point. it's just the video making is having some kind of trouble due to frame drops but i hope redmi will fix this issue with software update. otherwise I'm extremely satisfied with the Mobile photo.
I liked the Camera and Speed Is too Good as it is new also I liked and I loved to use this..
Awesome
One of the best mobile tilli date by Redmi!!  Highly recommend!!
fabulous phone in under 20000 ..buy it without thinking..
This Redmi is the best Redmi.
The cellphone is, quite good in terms of quality and screen colors are vibrant and looks good however the margins are still not perfect and the chin is too big.  overall value for money
osm phone 😘love that design,  camera , performance.
fabulous
internet very slow
everything's good and organized. Thanks Xiomi for the phone
Nice mobile phone
As usual, no words to describe about fast delivery and nice packing of Flipkart. The phone is undoubtedly elegant and feature packed beast which is also value for money and highly reccomended buy in the budget segment. I personally don't like Red colour. But this gradient finish is not just a red, but a combo of purple, pink and light red what Xiaomi calls as NEBULA RED...the most attractive among the 3 available colour varients.
good
awesome camera and fully loaded battery and also the killer performer
camera is good
aswm Image Quality ❤️❤️❤️
Very poor about ordrr
bad
excellent
awesome phone
Osm mobile best performance.
I dont like MIUI, it makes the phone slower.  storage speed is too poor.
i have wasted my Money
REDMI 7PRO IS A FEBOULES  PRODUCT OF XIAOMI. I FEELS SO LUCKY WHEN I OPEN THE BOX & PICKED UP THE MOBILE IN MY HAND. THANKS TO MAKE IT AWESOME MOBLE.
good camera quality
Camera app is bit slow and no slow motion recording. Battery is great , performance is good . Face detection works well but not secure.
Good
Redmi Note 7 pro  mobile phone is to oooooooo good. and awesome
Mk
it'd have been more better if front camera wasn't reduced from 20 MP
Very good phone in this price..
extraordinary ..... mind blowing and beleiveble ....... 😍😘 gud mobile .......
very good
very nice Amazing phone
Night shot is amazing features of redmi note 7 pro.
Its just awesome phone...camera is a beast
Review after using for last one week.. It has all the features which every smart phone needed. Camera might be 48MP but it won't be that crystal clear, you can observe the blur when you zoom in.. display is not that good.. speakers are just fine.. battery back up was good it lasts 2 days without pubg and with hard usage.. So finally it is ok ok mobile but when considering price you won't get better mobile than this.. if you have price restrictions and need a good mobile blindly go for it..
osm picture quality
Phone is getting switched off repeatedly after 20 days usage
Awesome phone in this price range.
Delivery hurts when you get the phone in 5 days.Not good delivery like E Cart.. Overall Phone is looking amazing.. Hope for the best.. Stay tuned for another comment after few days of use. Thx
like DSLR photography 😍.. thanks Xiaomi..also Flipkart
camera is wow
Nice phone but 42 mp is only gimmick
good
Just one word ' gadar '
This summer:  The ultimate power, the beast-> Redmi note 7 pro
best in class
NYC phone at this price
Very nice Product  and osm  looking
I finally got the RMN 7 Pro device using a third party app for placing the order. This ph has premium build quality with gorilla glass 5 in front & back. Battery, display, Cameras are superb. Performance of SD 675 top- notch👌. Realme 3 Pro can't beat RMN 7 Pro with an ordinary polycarbonate plastic back design. You can't consider Realme 3 pro as premium as RMN 7 Pro. Redmi is the best & king of smartphones. Just go for it guys blindly.
Very Nice Mobile in budget.
Ya it's very cheap and good to use and it's a classic phone
Wow Classic from mi

useless product dont buy
A screen defective phone got from Flipkart and given for replacement . They not accept replacement request after there visit of technical person and found defective. Replacement is rejected after visit. They told this  camara & screen is defective is commen. If anyone going to buy this product it will be your risk, because if they don't replace or return cash if u get a defective product.  They try to fool u till return policy time ends
It's very Good really amazing mobile value of money this product  good mobile but front camera is to very bad not zoom and zoom out
best phone in this praise love u mi

Great product at this price. It would have been better if Xiaomi provided fast charger in the box. Delivery from flipkart was great. Delivered here in Silchar(town in Assam) within 3 days.
I have received mobile just in three days.  Thanks to flip kart for this fast delivery. Mobile is working fine,  I found no issue with mobile. No screen flickering,  No speaker issue during calling,  No battery drainage issue,  No camera UI issue. Soon Xiomi will provide update to support Fortnight.  I am happy with this phone.
after few days ram is filling above 80% and 25gb was taken by system and it's starting hang and battery was drain within 5hours without using
My first and best phone smooth performance and good device by xiomi i love it must buy and enjoy
superb phone
dont buy  on flipkart
my phone display low brightness then Flickring display
I am waiting for next sale.... Don't think much more go for it blindly.
Review after almost one month use.... a perfect phone for a youngster pocket
Best one you cant get in this price range. Stylish and best performance smartphone. Also good battery backup. Overall totally satisfied with what Xiaomi is providing with this product. Being using Redmi note 4g, Redmi note 3, Redmi note 5 pro and now this one all thanks to the Xiaomi India for providing such smartphones in aggressive pricing.
i am using this phone since one month. the phone is really a good phone.valuable for money. camera is awesome.
Truly an world class device.
Best value for money under 14k....
Believe me guyz you can't get any phone at this price not even realme 3 pro can beat this.Everything is good and no issues found till now.one thing i like the most is the hand feeling of this phone.it feels like holding a flagship Go for it as it is giving more than what you are spending
overall good.. its just 1 day I am using.. lets just hope for the best..
Very good
Awesome pics and everything will be there
Osam mobile with this price range.. Very gud software but camera bump is very much outside from mobile body.. Overall nice quality
Mind blowing product.
Only one issue about the low voice of receiver. I hope it will be resolve soon. Overall awesome handset in this price range.
I love this product thank you Flipkart & MI India
Good product and performance is super
nice look this mobile
Great product
too much heating
super for good phone charger very good day pilp karat redmi note 7pro
Good budget Smartphone which has everything but not every phone is perfect. Here are its Pros 1. Good Battery Life 2. Good Design 3. Good User Interface 4. Periodic Updates. CONS :  Biggest CON is despite it's having Gorilla Glass 5 it still prone to scratches even small scratches. Check screenshot as I have used this phone for 10 days now. Camera is laggy sometimes.
Top in this budget.
Spectacular camera phone with full support of camera2api so Gcam can be installed without rooting.  I would suggest everyone to install Google camera as stock camera is not upto the mark as Gcam.
I would like to buy Flipkart protection..I forgot to add while purchasing mobile..and I couldn't add due to time issue..I think there should be option to add protection after purchasing mobile.
Best smartphone in budget segment Camera performance is amazing but you can improve that buy installing Google camera you can also click RAW format images with it one of the biggest issue of this phone is Advertisement in app and UI but thoose advertisement can be removed completely by disabling recommendations from each system app and setting
Light weight, speed performance, good camera, But Mobile and charger heats while charging as like all Xiaomi phones.
Awesome phone.. very stylish.. must buy phone under 15k.
The Phone feels very small like on hands still  being 6.3 inches
Best Camera Phone 2019
value for money ( 4 gb +64gb) ,  nyc & smooth smartphone... no heating issue in approx one month and I think no heating issue in future and also most perfect with  Mi (security patch updated March month)  every 3 to 4 month update coming......
those are the pictures captured by redmi note 7 pro ,awesome,good design and performence overall a great packege in my opinion.
Only thing i felt is.. Battery is weak wen compared to other Mi phones. It drains quite fast wen it in auto mode.
I was having Redmi note 4 before Redmi note 4 but I haven't noticed any extraordinary change I comparison with Note4 the only two things are supervisor in this model   and those things are 1. notch display and 2. The 48 MP camera with AI that's it...
beautiful one...
Excellent night photography... Battery not too good.... Some bugs found...
I bought this mobile few days back and within 15days my proximity sensor stopped to work.  and I am facing a worst problem whenever I am on call.  within 15 day,  my mobile have to visit service center and having operation of it.
Good phone with nice display. Camera is very good and thumbs up for night mode, battery back up is good. I am not into games, and not facing any heating issues.  Only thing the camera is projected out from the phone body and you may have to take care of it, while handling the phone. Overall good value for money phone.
Bezels could have more thinner. Everything is good👍 battery life is exceptional
I am just totally in love with the camera. I never expected such great performance at such a low price. This phone gives Entry Flagship level performance at a Mid range level price.
camera lag.... go for realme 3 pro
Quality smartphone. Great specifications and having excellent build quality with type-C port fast charging but disappointing point is that redmi not provided fast charger out of the box. total a value for money product at budget. must buy smartphone.
Redmi note 7pro is a very best mobile with this price rang....no one any mobile compite with it.....no 1indian smart phone and i love it.
Some times speaker not working properly.
awesome device nothing to beat in this range. playing pubg in high graphics
just irritated with ads....
EXL phone
Yet another awesome product by Redmi. Perfect in all aspects and undoubtedly best mid range phone in the market at present. Keep up the good work Xiaomi.
best phone ever !!
as per given 48 mega pixel camera not good results
i not recived this mobile
camera hanging and also noise issue
Charger adaptor is defective, is that replaceable or not?
great features.. but night mode performance is not good
It is hanging
This is an excellent all rounder mobile but I am so much disappointed with the camera. Its not that much good. The image clicked are little bit dark. Skin tone looks so darkish in 48 mp camera but selfie camera is ok. 48 mp camera is not living upto the expectations. Disappointed with camera.
With wonderful 48mp 📷  it gives us an excellent battery backup with high technology sd 675 processor.But something is bad that it takes much time to process the 48mp photos(almost 3-4s) & sometimes its hang for a couple of minutes when u click photos in pro mode. Its have the latest (2019-03-01) security patch level. Whatever it is an excellent nd balanced phone in this price.
not happy
There is quite a bit of lag and may be rectified with the software update. Camera seems to be okish not that great. Day to day performance seems to be fine. Software Optimisation seems to be the only problem. Else its bang for a buck.
bad experience
Camera is lagging,  Network reception is bad
Redmi note7 pro is realy good, and excellent performance while using pubg
Not good camera get hang
it's photo quality is excellent but only battery performance is not that much good.
CAMERA BROCKEN AUTOMETICALY

I felt the network reception quality is a bit weak in this smartphone other than that everything is  good..the camera is good , battery life is really good for a 4000mah battery, display quality is good...this is a value for money smartphone
very good prodect but 48mp camera is not at all good
Mobile Network Issues. Sometimes it automatically disconnect from mobile data even when mobile network is proper.
Awesome product by MI..Nice performance..
Nice mobile..! but Flipkart delivery is very bad
wifi problem.  could not able to connect to laptop.  need to replace.  not satisfied with the product.
super phone under 15 k
It is good mobile. but why 6gb is not available and if it is not available also on flipkart page it is showing.
Good Priced & better product.
every single thing is best..except for that 48mp camera...it should be pre loaded and also images gets pixilated when zoomed..in small distances...
redmi note 7 pro is good compared to vivo v9 pro.
awesome phone
not good this device
Fornt camera quality is vera bad. Poor
Great Performance And Quality Camera is the main Reasons why I am choosing Redmi Note 7 Pro..... Awesome MIUI .... Android Pie 9.0 , USB Quick Charge 4.0 is the best specification of this phone....Go For It...Thanks Flipkart fir timely delivery
Rear camera is above average but front camera is not up to mark. Rest is worth for money.
very nice phone
Thank you so much for quick delivery. The phone is superb it gives me a chance to give best gift to my wife...
Awesome great
camera is good but not at 48MP,  it's a Ford statement..
my phone keeps hanging up while i get incoming calls
Nice handset ,nice camera,good dlvry
it is a best phone in amount.... nd best camera
Nice
Battery backup low
this phone gets heat up while taking videos for just 2 mintues. do not waste money
Awesome Delivery from flipkart.... I observed Some of Negative Comment about its 48MP Camera, if the pic taken on 48MP mode then the camera app getting Crashed;, But Personally I cam tell none of the problems I never faced on 48MP Mode, Great Camera, Great Phone .. Thank You SuperConnect as well thank you MI &Flipkart
Heavy mobile, Camera functioning is slow, camera is k, but overall k phon.
very bad mobile don't purchase
The phone is good but sometimes it takes a little time to process, mainly in the case of camera when you use 48 megapixel. Also the display could be complete screen but the phone has boundaries which makes it not exactly a complete screen phone.
Headset Jack is not working.
Awesome phone with awesome price...
battery goes so fast
Good Mobile
Not worth it ! No improvement over last 1.5 - 2 years!
If u r are person who use phone for talking purpose then this is not a right choice becoz the ear piece is poor but u r are gamer then this is a smart choice
Osm smartphone ❤
nice mobile
automatic switch off 3 tymes
not good at all
IT IS GOOD DEVICE BUT THERE IS LAG IN IT WHENEVER YOU START THE PHONE FROM SLEEP MODE
i am note happy
portrait mode is a awesome
Camera Quality is good. But little bit lagging after capturing 48 mega pixels shoot. Screen resolution is very good but I think touches is not up to the mark. Overall performance is above average.
good smartphone this price,but front camera not good compear to Mi A2
Good budget phone
nice mobile
outstanding Mobile
plz include AMOLED in next gen MI Redmi Phones too
mobile phone IS awsome but flash sale is bad
worst
Superb Phone But only camera issues 48 mp shot need 1-4 sec to save and it has shutter lag while recording video if the phone is warm and the phone heats up fast while using camera
excellent superb
very poor design
Very worst phone I ever seen before. The phone will auto reboot or find system closed unexpectedly.the 48 mp camera will not work in my phone. If I changed 48mp and take photo it will processing for save but not save the photo in my gallery. Very very worst if I go to face book or gmail in my phone it's shows find device closed unexpectedly
from a week iam using redmi note 7pro mobile first day of delivering a mobile i faced the lot of issues by over heating hanging and camera lagging after next day i put for replacement a product i contacted flipkart for replace the item but they have not responded properly and they even not care about customers very bad experience with flipkart
best mobile in best price I love it
This phone has a very good Camera and  long lasting battery, one thing is not great in this phone. . It has lcd display, if there is amoled display in this then this will be a perfect budget smart phone in 15k category.
Don't buy this phone..... In this phone everything works great.......but the network issue is up to top level......I bought this phone in second sell.....since than...I thought... The network issue is due to service provider, but when I compared this phone with other Redmi phone like note 5 pro, note 4 .....this phone has very low connectivity.....in every other phone IPL match can   be watched live even in very poor condition but this phone unable to start live match or Youtube video, it sho...
Great phone with monstrous processor and battery life. Performance is also very impressive but 48 MP camera is slightly disappointing.
Amazing phone.......
excellent
great budget phone...  must buy..
pubg gameplay very smoothly and Snapdragon 675 processor best processor on budget phones and 48MP camera so good
it's so disgusting from flipkart i got the mobile which is lagging whenever i am using camera whether I'm using 12 mp or 48 mp my mobile is getting switch off 5-6 times by itself and when i registered complaint for replacement i didn't get any response the technician first cancel the meeting by saying that i was not available even he didn't call me and when he visited i showed him every problem even i showed the video i recorded and the screenshot as well but he mentioned that the problem has...
unbelievable!!!!!!!
Just nice
bad products
i am a big fan of samsung but now i am a fan of redmi because it is giving all thing in a good priceoverall it is a good smartphone under this price range according to me this is a good package battery back up of this phone is good and camera is beast black colour is also good over all rating is 10/10 i am fully satisfied with this there is a only cons of that is a there is a no fast charger in the box
Value for money ....If you want best budget phone under 15k with all features ... Obviously 48mp camera under 15k... It's awesome
I had the camera preview issue customer support was very worst. They had never resolved the issue so far.
camera is hanging while taking pics, battery not upto the mark it drains quickly

Great
Amazing phone for the price. No other phone can beat this. I love the performance of powerful sd675 processor and the all new glass body design. I forgot to mention that the camera is amazing too. Worst part is flash sale where a common user can't buy this normally. Use script or chrome extension to auto buy.
good
these phone was a killer smartphone in midrange price phone in global and I was a wait for this phone for three month

owsom mobile.    speed nyc.
The phone is very nice,  design is very premium.  i am facing problem in 4g volte mode.  not getting proper notice on calls and having trouble with network issues in sim 2 slot.  as it has a hybrid sim slot. i dont have option of putting it in sim 1 slot if I want to use memory card.  so kindly work on that in updates and make both sim spots efficient enough to use 4g volte. Without any issue.!
device was great I did not like the video recording of the n7pro it could be great and when I first booted the device it was very laggy and was freezing in switching between apps and the portrait photography when u click the portrait it takes time to process it and during that the phone freezes
camera poor quality

nice product thnx mi
the redmi note 7 pro ..is just Super phone. super looks and Camera quality just mind-Blowing. as u can see its 13 mp selfie camera , picture quality is really good.. its value for money phone. u can take it.
best phone in the budget segment.upgraded from Note 4.  When samsung says 'Dont teach your father how to make phones'.. Redmi says "chill grandpa.. your time is over..apna time aayega ..apna time aa gayaaa "
Great Phone. Battery doesn't support my needs. But all other features are awesome.
super mobile, but camera is not 48mp
facing network issue and front speaker issue while on call
speaker  is making buzz sound when playing songs and when dalling the ear speaker also making buzz sound.  not expected from xiomi
Awesome product
After 5 days of usage I am honestly satisfied with this device...In this price range no other device can give you this type of camera quality, performance, built quality and design and also battery is really good, it can give you easily 1 or 1.5 days battery life on moderate use.If I am telling about 48MP feature that company hyped too much then personally I think there's no big difference between 12MP normal mode and 48MP mode, the only difference in 48 MP mode is it has superzoom ability co...
more 5 phones
every thing good but when the incomeing caller voice too low
Good phone... worth money
good
camera and display very very good
good mobile at the price I loved it
back camera so good but front camera average
Excellent camera long battery life price very good
Nice phone and performance good
The camera specification of 48 mp albeit good but not the best.  When you are out on broad daylight and wish to use your phone,  you have to increase your brightness to full which reduces battery power.  Excessive usage for a longer time can cause apps to lag a bit.  Charging is faster though.
good
nice phone . value for money . overall good
Great smartphone with great camera. This smartphone is value for money and its camera is comparable to that of samsung s10 and iphone Xs Max. No screen bleeding no muffled sound in front speaker. front speaker is loud and clear and screen is mind blowing. In hand it feels really premium. Now let me share a picture that I've taken with Redmi note 7 pro and that picture would blow your mind and can be seen below.. :D
Little disappointment in terms of front camera, memory management and always with hybrid sim slot..: (
This mobile was amazing and perfect in budget phones. also the look of note7 pro was incredible.
very nyc Camera quality,48mp extra mode included,A normal pic hve a avrg of 7-8 mb, in 48mp mode an normal pic is 15-17 mb... high gaming performance.. We can play Pubg in HD at 'High' frame rate, now you people can understand... one of the best phones xiaomi released.. With a Catching Glass gradient back panel...

First Nebula Red color pic in review.....  awesome look .... fall in love with this....
Awesome  with good camera and battery in this price range  but hybrid sim slot  has bee  the weak point of Redmi phones as most of their Mobiles come with hybrid sim slot.
I want to give a 5 star but I was gave 4 Star because first time I received a defected mobile and that was not charging but after replacing the mobile work perfectly.
Not good...bad experience...not worth of 48 MP Camera....
Excellent Purchase
Amazing and super fantastic phone under budget,  camera is just awesome,  performance is excellent,  must go for it 👍

After 5 days of usage everything is gud,  battery backup camera etc awesome.. But one issue I got is headphone icon got Stucked and speaker stopped working for a minute... Bad experience for headphone jack
delivery was too slow almost 6,7 days camera contains too many brilliant features. other specs u can see on internet. battery life seems to be not that much like it was said on youtube videos. The looks are better than u think specially blue colour.
what a phone nice to use it, it is like a glass phone every thing, camera performance, battery backup is owsm

back camera is super mobile bulid qilulity is super
Super cool!!  Software needs a bit of tweaks
Best phone this year
The Phone doesn't come with a fast charger thought the phone supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0. It literally takes 2 hours to charge 100% from 0%. Camera quality is awesome first picture on this phone made my heart meltdown. It's tough to find a back case which protects the camera as the camera lens are bumpy. I'm disappointed with flipkart as they didn't sort the problem which I faced while ordering this phone. Overall I'm happy with the product but disappointed with Flipkart's response. If...
All good but found the brightness is slightly lower than usual

Redmi Note 7 Pro - Space Black - The Black Beauty
Excellent note 7 pro
toooo gud
Value for money
camera ,performance,design awesome
Not so good....camera not working properly at 48mp.
Lags in pubg.. Front cam is bad.. Battery drains fast..
camera quality is poor
better to buy Samsung M30..MI is fooling with 48mp but result is zero
poor material used mobile
rear camera is just ok.. apart from dew drop notch everything is similar to Redmi note 6 pro..
battery is not so good
bad lick
heating issue
very bad dont buy this product.. camera very bad not get 48mp...
Awesome phone .....fully paisa basool ...can purchase blindly........
48 MP CAMERA NO PORTRAIT MODE
heating on pubg in 5min of play. also skipped some frame on hd settings.
ads phone
Best camera & stylish smartphone made by Redmi, best phone under 15k, #I❤️MI
good camera but not real #48mp camera 📷 and may you find Lord shiv in this picture..
mobile get heated while charging and while using also....very poor product....
Phone is nice but lack of super amoled display
I had a second thoughts about buying it at first because I saw some reviews saying that the camera was laggy or that the earpiece speaker was bad. But I didn't face any of those problems. So far no problems. Very satisfied with the purchase.
I recently bought a MI redmi note 7pro on 15 march 2019, and today on 27 March 2019 While using the headphone I found that I headphone jack is not working, and when I contact MI store and Flipkart for replacement they refuse
awesome phone best product of mi superb camera
super vey nice camera
mind blowing purchase really good manufacture
48 mp camera very nice high dimand phone value of money
,10/10 best of Redmi
awsome mobile
good
no quality in camera, zero as per compare 48 mp any phone in india
48 MP only showing but no quality and camera image blurred when zoomed.
Camera lagging, not able to take continuous photos, performance is very slow, denied to replace it... very very disappointed... waste of money.. waste of time..
poor product.
camera not working and camera app full hanging problem
money Worthy...15-25 Mb images capture in 48 mp camera.. battery performance is average . overall give 5 star.
display bezel are very big
speaker nice vaipret not work touch screen still  totaly bad
camera quality ok but very slow while taking snap also hang when video recording. lots of add redmi failed my expectation first time also heating issue I feel most of the time. half of the paint was gone in the speaker so am going to return for exchange and delivery was took 5 days even I have filipcart plus
very poor build quality.. very poor cemera.. very poor display.. friends never buy it.
worst camera. don't buy
superb mobile
phone is having heating issue although i use only instagram for 30-35 min only 48 mp camera is good, but  it is for zoom only in close range 48 mp not good enough battery charging is fast and drain is also fast but atlast it will go upto 4-4.5 hours on heavy use but heating is major problem in summer you will dont think to play it for more than 2 hours.                                       👍 if you think useful
camera is very bad
not to much good as expected,  battery is not performing 24 hour and also the camera is not too much nice as I was thinking redmi note 7 pro in my side not good.....
this mobile compare to other mobile i think batter then
Awesome device. Rear camera, performance, battery backup, display quality, looks all are simply superb. Only cons are hybrid sim tray and no Quickcharger in the box. I had to buy a Qualcomm Quickcharge 3.0 charger separately @ 500 rupees.
mobile overheat
There should not be permission to xiaomi to sell redmi note 7 pro in india. A major problem in this is network problem. 4g net speed is like 2g.
camera is very bad
I am happy to buying this product in 3rd sale very nice product nice battery backup nice display quality and also Snapdragon 675 is very fast camera quality is very good finally overall best phone in this price range
COMPARE TO REAL ME note 7 pro is better phone
Display is average . Except display everything nice.
best mobile
it has not even been one month since I have purchased the phone and the headphone jack is not working
wonderful
very bad
Nice Phone with Amazing Camera . 48Mp Not Really As 48Mp . It's Look Like 16MP
one oth best till now ,  DONT LISTEN OTHERS JUST BUY IT
Camera not up to mark.... Like 48 mp
good phone
just like any typical Mi device. If you've used Mi device before there's nothing new in it. there's so much hype about the camera. there's nothing like 48 MP in it. Just gimmick. don't buy if you are looking for better camera within the phone. camera is same as other phones in this price category, nothing special. battery and performance wise it's quite ok.
best camera📷 phone
Super phone

unbelievable camera quality
well, Xiaomi has launched this phone with the greatest specification on the affordable price Rs.13999.00 and this product is excellent and give the great feeling and camera is awesome but there is just slight difference between 48 MP or 5 MP also the properties of 48 Mp is too large instead of 5 MP about 12 MB plus but the detailing is brilliant but in case of processing it is too good and you won't face any buffering, fast charging and Xiaomi also added some new feature in that to enhance th...
frnds do not buy this phone because heating issue

Good Product
awsome phone for this Price 😍😘😘😘😘
Best phone in this price range, back camera is amazing in good as well as in low light scenarios, it's front camera is average and most of the time it takes shakey photos, in low light it is even worse. You can use Google camera to improve front camera performance as the hardware of the camera is quite good.
Amazing phone
problem in phone no return and no solution
battery actually not support fast  charging ...........low battery life ..its run only 5-7 hours
Camera bump problem
awesome
Great buy! Best phone in this price range.
wow.  what a phone.. I love it..  thanks Xiomi..  Ee sala cup namde
The product is nice but there is no use of 48mp camera. 12mp is enough..Note 7 and note 7 pro have almost same ..
Fantastic Smartphone.
Great phone..crisp display.. good battery life and the 48 MP camera is icing on the cake.. way to go..
superb
nice
Osam back cemara
overall a very good phone as per price but little disappointed with the 48mp camera pictures as I don't find much difference in 12 and 48mp pictures . however. definitely recommend for the overall performance
super mobile worth for the price tag of 13999/-
The back camera at default mode itself is producing the best photos in the segment.. one of the best redmi phones ever launched in india.. go for it..
I loveeeee it . And Thank u FLIPKART.😘. FOR FAST DELIVERY.
Awesome phone Budget Smart Phone

Very bad if you give huge amount and no triple slot and not good selfie then its better to buy realme 2pro
Superb phone at an incredible price. The features are very impressive and this time Redmi has added fast charging also, which makes this phone a really good choice for those who want high specs at a justified price.
You should go for Realme 3 Pro.
battery is not good... touch is not so smart
I ordered this phoen for my father after 15 days i get to see the cam broken and it has been handled with care.no idea how it was broken.seems the cam glass is very delicate.cant return it though.

Not satisfied this product
camera not at all good, picture quality is not satisfaction as they shown on launch event, note 5 pro is much better camera then note 7 pro
It doesn't have gorilla glass.
I charged the mobile to 100% and kept it idle for a night. When I checked the next day, the phone was off as the battery was dead. The replacement process is also not easy, they(flipkart executives) are trying to avoid the replacement as much as possible. First time this has happened to me after years of online shopping. Disappointed, Flipkart!
excellent
a little bit weighted due back side glasses but it's ok.....👌all thing is good.

VERY GOOD RESULT
Good camera, good battery life and excellent performance ✌
Value Of Money... Good
Good and smooth Touch
excellent product and fast charging
I felt camera wise this will give better performance,  while full zoom in 48mp image,  it's getting noise in the picture.  Other wise MI introduced a good product
product come on time but some time software bugs found need stable version, all over it's good in this price range
good product but camera is not real 48 megapixel

Best smartphone in this Price..Love it . Quality Is superb and Beautiful Look.

very nice phone 😘 must buy awesome phone
Nice product... Camera output is amazingly wow... It capture too much detail... Performance is quite good but the battery sometimes drain quickly... The glass body looks stunning, the black is really the black beauty... But all I can say is that it is really a way much better than the Realme 3 pro in all state and within 20,000/- this is the camera beast...
it's awesome... 😍
Phone is beast for its price. fast charger isn't included in box thts only disadvantage of this phone.

good quality
Great phone at this price point, But battery drains out faster when u indulge in normal surfing, Haven't tested battery while playing games, Overall great product for this price point, Had MI preferred 5000 Mah battery, This phone would have killed the market,Anyways phone is made in India by a Chinese Company, Assume that some Indian worker would have had a hand in manufacturing this piece. 🙂
nice phone
super mobile camera 48+5 good
selfie camera not good if you are looking for selfie camera, don't buy that.display average.battery backup is good.
Redmi note 7 Pro is super phone at reasonable price offered by Mi. Awesome camera, processor, screen and services. recommended for all class people.
the phone is very good looking and best for every side
Thanks to Flipkart and delivery man...

osm camera... capture performance slow
I have  been using this phone for past 3 days couldn't have found a better product at this price range. The features are amazing touch fingerprint sensors works like magic, the camera is topnotch. the quality sharpness clarity is mind blogging and the stylish gorilla glass on both the sides have got all the eyes on it. A perfect smartphone at minimum price line. couldn't be more satisfied.

Been a month since I received this product.  Working really fine but hangs sometimes.  Camera is really good but does not support zoom in 48mp. Amazing display to watch movies and play games.  Battery works really fine.  Highly recommend for people doing photography or to the beginners.  Here's some shots I captured 😇

Everything else is value for money in this mobile phone instead of one thing that is heat during game playing.

after using product one month writing thus review, excellent product by xiaomi there is a bug related to charging while overcharging the device turn off automatically and restart when removing from charging and secod is of wifi which not detected sometime don't know exactly scenario for wifi. but overall the product is good.
night mode camera is best.smooth,fast,good look.😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘
nice one
nice mobile to use as it has all the features we needed in it
Good
Great deal
Nice
nice product, good internet modem, just camera quality lacks, some heating, fragile body and slow charging makes it a bit less value for money. But Xioami can fix some issues and it has nice hardware
camera quality is best i think at this price range . value for money no doubt.
excellent
best  under 20k phone ,2019
I just love this redmi note 7 pro picture quality is best night mode feature is love overall performance is good value for money 😍😍😍😍.  sourabh choudhari 🙂
good picture quality
Overall phone is good but I think 48 MP camera is an only marketing strategy. There is a little bit difference between 12 MP camera and 48 MP camera. So If you want to buy this phone for 48 MP camera then it's not a worthy deal. You can go for Redmi Note 7 also. Service of Flipkart for this phone is too late for me. I got in 7 days after ordered.
just awesome...!!!!
Nice camera

amazing phone by redmi
A good budget Smartphone which has everything however here I would like to mention about Gorilla Glass. I don't think it's having Gorilla Glass 5 protection as I can clearly see small Scratches on my phone despite it never fell down. I just put it in my pocket without keys or sharp edge things but still it has got small scratches which is clearly visible. I highly recommend everybody to use Tempered glass.
super product
alot of hype was created  for blue colour varient but  i think   for prolonged use, black is all time best . .  as edges are of plastic so colour gets removed  when colured varient phone falls  . telling this as i bougt    blue    so this is all i have to suggest otherwise no complaint for performance
superb 📱
Super cool Nice Look Red Colour
front camera could have been better... other wise it's an excellent phone. Love the colour of the phone (Nebula Red) n design as well.
back camera focus not working properly,  focus and capture the image for slowly

good camera....  nice look...
I've been using suing this phone since a while and I enjoyed it. the only problemlem that I faced was the camera is not as good as I expected. in low lights the pictures looks like plastic. I bought this phone just because of the camera however I felt noelw that that camera is not that superb if you are clicking pictures in artificial lighting.
this is a Nice device.....and I love note 7 pro.....

Osm 48 camera amezing perfomence
This is again a masterstroke from Mi. After the relative failure of Note 6 (owing to its lack of hardware update), this one gets them right back on track. Leave 48mp aside, the camera at this price is perfection. The display is great and the battery, as has been in the Note series, is really powerful. I don't like the new colors but that is a personal choice, I have friends that love them. Got 14k budget for a phone, your search should stop here, ie, if you manage to get this one in one of th...
Camera clarity is awesome especially in night mode worth for money I loved it 💞😍

very good product but we can't track my product
very good
Looking at the price point,  this phone is a beast. It has a powerful 675 Soc, with 48mp (quad pixel bind technology)  which provides great depth to pictures, great build quality. Battery back up is great bcoz if it's 4000mah battery. Well glass back looks great, feels premium but accidental drops can cause damage(though protected by Corning gorilla Glass 5 on both sides). Overall a great deal. Go for it!
Fabulous
over all phone is good camera is best but battery drains fast
Mi products are known for their value for money since the introduction of their first flagship product Mi3 in India. Quality and finishing of their products are class leading; and Redmi 7 Pro is no different...Thank you Mi India.

very
Everything is good in this product I am giving one less star for the bad courier service and it's technical faults .The product reached in time actually pretty much fast then I expected but there was no update on the shipment and also I was not able to track it although Flipkart customer support assured me that I will get the product before promised delivery date but I was worried and afraid also on the other hand that I will get my ordered product or not since it took very long time to order...
it's amazing. and flipkart delivery is to fast
Hd preview will amaze you.
got this phone trying million of times...this is like the most perfect phone...the overall performance is just outstanding...and battry backup is just insanely good...and the cameras are like outta world I have the galaxy note 8 with me and I'd say note 7 pro has far better camera than that phone...and I think this phone is even faster than that...the design just feels as premium as a flagship phone and feels outstanding in hands....the only thing I dont like and I hate is the flash sale...I ...

all are boasting about this phone to be very performing phone having a good camera.  i'll say the pubg is not running smoothly in medium settins, the net connectivity is poor then my other 2 phones I have (nokia 6.1 plus and redmi note 5 pro) the low light indoor camera performance is worst. suggest to buy realme 3 pro instead

good mobile in this price segment
Good design, impressive audio quality from the headphone jack, battery backup is excellent, for camera use it with Google camera and low light photography improves a lot, type C port is a must have feature in 2019, selfie camera is not that good, charging speed is a bit slow but I can get the Quick Chage 4 when it's available, for ads in UI you can disable it, and lastly camera bump is too much you have to get a seperate back cover as the one provided in the box is useless. Overall a great ph...
I just bought this phone for camera it's really amazing to get 48MP camera with this amount. worth for money
not worth it....camera is written 48mp but its just on paper....look wise also phone is average....there is no difference in looks as compare to old mi phones...better go for samsung A or M series.

lovely phone♥️
good mobile
super phone i like it
Camera picture quality gets tored up after zooming
More than what you expected, only one complaint about miui is that miui stock rom contains ads
Very nice im very happy
camera could be better ,why everyone is so excited, camera is slightly better than 6 pro... that's it..performance is great and battery backup too, but I still think Realme3 pro is better than this one...no sd card slot only hybrid slot still ...many aspects still need to be  better , also ads are irritating...
value for money..

It has a perfect camera and budget phone. it has long battery also. but during capturing long video and continue photography it starts over heating.
Superb phone
It is a beast,  camera is extremely good and the picture quality is extremely good and crisp,  lookwise it is damn awesome and feels good in hand without cover but the camera bump is bit of an ache as you have to be careful sometime, performance is fine but sometime UI gets hang or bit unresponsive for couple of seconds,  there are minor ads in some apps especially the gallery or player app which pops up after you see videos,  rest of it is great.  it is a complete value of my money
Niccc super

Great Camera Mobile, Design is very nice but the performance is not too good..  i was expecting more..
when the battery level is too low that is less than 5% the amount of heat dissipated by phone is too high,It takes much time to capture 48MP photo and size of that photo is also too high in the range of 12-15 mb......so be cautious except that every thing is completely fine including camera........#in love with redmi note 7 pro.........A awesome mobile for middle class budget ......
camara is gud

Overall good phone but should go for higher RAM as the AI used needs better RAM.  Phone is little slow because of that sometimes getting stuck sometime. Will not recommend if you use heavy or apps which needs good ram.
One of the best phone in this' range camera was so fabulous
worth every penny.. looks are premium..best smartphone till date.. performance is great...best for gaming especially pubg..camera outperforms every Mobile on this segment.. overall I'm happy with this purchase.. Flipkart's delivery is good as expected

supperbbb phone which i got at this price.....
A good budget mobile in the price of 14k Display quality is good. but I didn't like the camera quality I'll give 2.5/5 for camera. iPhone's 5s 8MP is is better than this 48MP.

Powerful featured phone under 15k
to be fair i was expecting a great phone after note 5 pro but this was disappointing. There is a visible lag in everything- cant say its sw or hw side. Camera captures great photos but takes a while to launch..the worst part are the speakers. There is just one speaker at the bottom while it looks like there are 2 . the sound is too low and becomes audible only after reaching the halfway point using volume buttons. also there are frequent breakdowns of the speaker in the form of a cranky robot...
camera quality good...
exelent
Very good phone at this price I really feel good in using this phone

You will not get what has been much hyped about... Camera quality is not good nor its speaker quality... Also phone heats up very quickly and sometimes lags alot especially during call it turns on to loudspeaker mode without having been touched on that function...
Excellent product with reasonable price.

amazing performance and very good for daily use as well as extreme use like PUBG gaming extra. The processor is blazing fast & MIUI 10 is very well optimized which gives quick response. camera quality is very good and all features like portrait mode, bokeh mode etc are available except slow motion video. Sometimes heating phenomenon was observed but it was observed after extensive use of game or mobile data. Rest the mobile is excellent choice for anyone who want speed, response & camera qual...

A budget phone  which comes with a 48 mp camera which may sound wow but actually isn't, because it captures the pictures from 12 mp camera only,  also in comparison to other phones of same range it is a great deal but frankly I'm not satisfied with the camera battery life is good and also it doesn't comes with a fast charger, if you want it you have to buy it separately so, camera not so good as said but still a good phone in the budget phones.
Good feature

Best smartphone i purchased till now.    Screen quality, speakers loudness is awesome. Miui is user friendly. Camera quality is best, only little laggy. Hope upcoming updates will fix this issue. Best smartphone.
nice look & design that phone. but camera to buggy software , not support well when we started 48 MP (should be clear in next software update) . value of money phone in that range.
Nice phone , but, Camera is lagging in portrait and pro mode. Rest is all fine till now.
value for money, excellent camera
Nice
Very good phone, but battery and volume level of sound could be better.
all thing are better.  but front camera better in day light and artificial light than note 5pro but in very low light front camera is little weak note 5pro. yet.  note 7pro best phone
THE BEST smartphone under 15k budget.. nothing more is needed to say..
value for money
superb phone
SUPERB PHONE AWESOME EXPERIANCE OVERALL
The display is very low light. Sound is very less. And when u ll b in call the sensor misbehaving and making d display on off on off causing call hold and disconnect.
Awesome
display ,bettery good camera also good but it's hang when activating 48 MP Camera 😔😔😔😔
Awesome
camera not as expected
best mobile in 13999 rupees
good product at reasonable price. lot of mi bloatware though which could be irritating at times. night camera is great. you dont really need to use the 48 mp pro camera unless you want more detailed pictures (which take lot of storage around 13 mb per pic). The default camera mode is great. phone heats up a little when you play games for a long time. battery lasts for 1 day atleast with average use.
good
The device was great but the front facing camera isn't upto the mark.
No words to explain, the quality in this price range is just superb.
Good phone at that price
Overall a good package by xiaomi.
Too many ads.  Feels unsafe to use.

Not satisfied with the 48 mp camera.highly saturated photo.Not satisfied at all.Samsung lover can't be satisfied by Redmi phone.
Quite a good phone, speed is decent, could be more as it uses snapdragon 675, camera is very very good, face unlock a bit slow, and Playing videos on YouTube or Instagram makes some weird noise from the speaker sometimes. PUBG gameplay very awesome no lags, HD graphics with high frame rate, rest all good
Nice CAMRA,full one day battery backup,good speed,full paisa wasool product.

Awsome phone with awsome specs...  Camera is good...especially in potrait mode images are very good..battery life is decent...  display is too good...  totally a power packed phone at a very decent price...  really good value for money...  Only thing is we are getting a hybrid sim tray which is a small drawback...  but comparing the specs at this price we can ignore that and add a memorycard..

phone looks good. I found heating problem with the mobile. it starts getting heated as you turned on the camera that lead to drian battery quickly. 2 min of camera usage became the mobile heated and battery usage dropped from 24 to 18%. hope this issue will get fix by future software updates.

BEST FOR LOW BUDGET
I was worried about this phone before buying this phone due to some negative review.. But after 3 flash sale and so many tries from different account I got this mobile... I Play PUBG daily but haven't seen any hitting issue at all..  It's performance top notch...  No major ads problem even I never notice any ads.. It's built quality is premium.. As I never use 2nd sim Hybrid slot doesn't matter to me... First it's  camera bump is too big for me even after case but within week I am use to it.....
good
48 MP camera is just a formality, actual image quality is 12 MP and it also heats up with 5 min of usage. Battery backup is good with fast charging support and display quality is slightly improved from Note 6 Pro. Phone feels very heavy in hand and processor is not optimized properly with MIUI 10. You may see lags in heavy intenive tasks like Pub G and Asphalt 9. Mi ads coming in their own apps are irratates the users but its not a big issue. Phone is good and sturdy but performance not feels...
Awesome.... Value for money

this is the best smartphones will get under 15k segment. Awesome performance, better battery, killer camera. I recommend this smartphone to everyone who are looking for a smartphone which gives better value for money. killer specs which doesn't get in a small price point. the new society sd675 also performing very well. also the gpu performing very good pubg can be played in ultra smooth lag freely. the front optics is killer and awesome. so this product can be purchased without second though...

best phone under 15000
Best Phone.
Great performance as expected, camera is good but don't expect a flagship camera experience, display is good almost feels like AMOLED, speakers are loud enough with decent bass, UI is smooth, the only issue is with fingerprint sensor which is not fast enough at least for me and battery backup, I'm not a tech expert but a 4000mah should last at least 1-1.5 day but I 'm only getting backup of 12-14 hours with moderate usage, I'm not into gaming so I have absolutely no idea about gpu performance...
Excellent mobile...
glass quality low

Superb product from redmi
This is a monster piece phone createe by xiomi. Best in class definitely. Just 1 complain, not sure if it the problem In all the pieces or only in mine, the Volte facility is disabled in my phone, raised a complain to the Servify team also but i have been told to visit nearest service station for this issue. I would just like to suggest the team if this problem is consistent with others as well, it would be great if u get this fixed with the MIUI 11 update.

awesome but heat mobile
Quality of the phone for the price range is awesome. Starting from the build quality to the performance everything is good. Camera is nice for the price. Although I think the "night mode" (under camera) is not great as advertised. May be future software update will upgrade it (if xioami wants!!). Display is crisp. Software is subjective. Battery is great. With SD 675AI the overall performance of the phone is awesome. True value for money
great device
super good product battery backup 1 1/2 day only
best in price and performance...
First there was an issue with 48mp camera but after update, it's okay now and it's superb in this price range

unbelievably phone perfect display front camera also super I just loved it
Awesome
You cannot beat Xiaomi. Pocket friendly budget and high end spec. The phone looks premium in black ( just my point of view) but blue and other colours are too good too. In the price range the specs are very great. And I think Mi has gained the trust of our and one can easily trust them and buy their phones.

Mind-blowing Mobile by Redmi
very good smart phone
What a phone redmi finally got the design right
excellent built quality... nice camara.... nice display... go for it
mobile is very osm. actually pros more then cons. cons is 2-3 like hybrid sim slot, heavy weight, camera bump is very out from back surface. n camera is very good. screen is also very good if compare with others redmi mobiles. sound is very good of both speakers. i cant say that music sound is low. means from my opinions music sound is high. that's means over all performance is very good. this is valuable for money. n i want say also one thing that flipkart service is very fast. thnxx flipkar...
awesome Mobile phone
camera is good
Neptune blue was a much better choice
Currently this is the best you can buy at this price range. I saw some people complaining about earpiece but as of now I didn't face such issues .But there is this huge camera  bump that is among the thickest we have seen on smartphones recently you need to invest on good phone cover to protect it from damage. l am attaching both 48mp and 12 mp shots to get you an idea about the camera performance.
nice Vera level
Low cost and awsome mobile
I Love Redmi

super phone
Nice
I bought this phone on the 3rd sale. So far so good. Fully satisfied with the performance. this phone doesn't heat up during day to day usage and the camera is too good. It always stays at 12mp, but if you switch to 48mp, captured photo takes 10sec to process. So that 48mp option is not for quick capturing. It a little gimmick. 48mp is good for capturing landscape..take your time and capture the beauty at the highest resolution. All other things are perfect.... ram management is on point. Ove...
Best mobile smartphone under 15k.. Camera is good while using with 12 MP, but not that much with 48 MP Night mode is excellent. Overall good package under 15k..
This phone is awesome but the bump camera is not good it scratched
Had high hopes from this phone but there are some serious issues that needs to fixed. First of all batter is draining heavily. Also it has heating issues which no one is actually talking about. And the ram management is poor.
excellent
This is awesome mobile, camera is good, battery life extraordinary, model wonderful.. but some software is struck some time, Not all time. And Ads so irritating, but i change some settings now a time reduce the ads little bit... Otherwise mobile is Ultimate level... 90/100
very good mi note7pro

I am just using this phone for two days. Bulid quality  and performance is too good.  If primary camera is one more present then it will be amazing.

Writing the review after 10 days of usage..Got this phone with axis bank credit card 5% offer on emi.Now,whether you guys believe or not but 48 MP actually does a fabulous job in retaining the details of the pic...checks the images i am attaching,you guys would actually be able read one shop name which is actually in very dark and even i wasn't able to see the same with my eyes...so,100 percent it does a great job...yes,it takes little time to save the pics but that is not a big issue,it can ...

In this price range this is a good smartphone, but instead of giving 48 mp camera xiaomi should concern about the quality of camera. day performance of camera is good, but in night, there is so much noise in pictures. In terms of design and build quality i must give 5 stars to this phone as well as performance of this phone is also good .. overall a good package in this price segment, recommend to buy it..

perfect phone on this price range with mind blowing features, i loved this phone, the only annoying thing is that when we using the camera a slight heating is there and some times the camera is not responding and then we should have to restart the phone, i think Xiaomi may resolve this problem through further updates...... and I'm waiting for that. any way I like this phone very much 😍😍

Camera 📷 is Good. Feels premium At this price segment. u can install Google Camera. U can play PUBG Mobile in High Settings without any Glitches 😋.

Redmi note 7 pro best phone
delivered be prefect good.
Worth buying.
I have seen so many negative reviews about the audio quality and display flickering. But i didn't experienced any of these problems till now. The only thing is, when we open the 48MP cam, sometimes its stop working suddenly and requires a reboot. That's the only problem I'm facing. I think it can be resolved by software updates. Overall the phone is superb.
Gorgeous...

The camera is not 48MP.. because snapdragon 675 have not 48MP ..in 48MP you can't use AI , Night mode .
Value for money,  48MP camera is awesome,  though it takes a few seconds to process but the clarity in all the modes work perfectly.  Battery is enough for a day's use on high performance settings.  Overall a nice bundle at the price.  😄
worth for a money
superbb quality performance...and I can't explain the quality of camera.. awesome👌👌😊😊😊
thanks for fast delivery budget beast
just wow
The phone is great for gaming. PUBG runs very smooth. If u are thinking of buying a phone for gaming purposes then it is the best option. Coming on to the camera,is really impressive. but if u r really not in to getting the latest processor SD675 and the so called 48 mp camera,, u can go for the redmi note 7 also. I will tell that it has also got great gaming performance..
nice product

Recommend phone....their no phone to beat in this range..
A phone which can even beat a flagship. It has an exceptionally good camera which seems to be better than Oneplus 6T in terms of sharpness and dynamic range. After all someone's word is proved to be right by MI that- "Cheap phones are getting good. And good phones are getting cheap."- MKBHD(Marques Brownlee).
Superb Camera Quality and performance

Awesome Phone with Killer specs...Totally Satisfied With This Phone
good phone on price range. initially for the product that had speakers problem. flipkart replaced it. decent battery life. initially got good battery life, after week usage, i see drop in avg drop in battery performance. 48mp camera is good. display quality is good. face recognition and figure scanner worms great. overall decent buy. just have a check on audio speakers after buy
The phone is excellent considering the price point.The camera is the one thing that stunned me the most, i mean the it handles the tricky photos is amazing and the bokeh mode which xiomi has given..... is truely a game changer even sometime it can compete to a professional DSLR camera.                                                                                 ______________________Pros & Cons_____________________.

Amazing Smartphone I have ever seen in my life. The camera beast it too good to perform your day to day multitasking. medium battery efficient. You will have to charge it ones perday .(Recommended to buy Mi 10000MAh power bank which supports quick charge 3.0).I wasn't having another smartphone so I could not upload many images.

Every aspect of the mobile works as charm. Performance is 🔥. Camera is awesome(48MP). The display looks awesome. It's pretty large. Other features are all good. The look of the handset is different with colors. All other features are similar to other Redmi phones. Overall it's a worth buying.

Best phone in this price range. Camera is the best part of the phone, images are awesome without 48 megapixel also. Battery charges quickly. They should have given some apps for the files like PDF,ppt instead of sharechat and other but that's fine. Best performance for high end apps. Sound quality is too good. I haven't found any con about the for now. Delivery took 5 days that's disappointing. PAISA WASOOL PHONE. Display is blinking at low brightness.
Nice one
If you are a MI user then you can not feel anything different with the phone until you are going to clock the pictures or video shoot or playing any kind of game...Body finishing is marvelous.looks like a premium class phone. Great stell in this price segment.
